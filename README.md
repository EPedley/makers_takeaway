# makers_takeaway

As part of my progress through the Makers course I have created a Takeaway class system. The system enables the user to:
- Create new instances of the Takeaway class
- Add instances of the Dish classes, with name and price variables
- Visualise the menu, add dishes to your order and place an order
- The project then uses the Twilio Python package to send an SMS to the user informing them they're order is

To approach this project I used a TDD approach, so the project relies on Mocks to unit and integration test the class system, as well as mock the API package.
